This project allows the user to search the Spotify music catalog (you must have a Spotify account to use), and can create a custom playlist to save to your Spotify account.

The user can search by Name, Title or Album and can initiate the search by button click or enter on the search field.

The user can also change the name of the playlist by clicking on the name and appending it.

Songs can be added to the playlist or removed once put on the playlist before it is saved to Spotify.
